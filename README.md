# üìÅ Holistic Processing Illusion Code

This repository contains five deep learning models implemented in both **Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)** and **Python script (`.py`)** formats.  
Each notebook includes model construction and output visualization, while the Python files contain identical logic for standalone execution.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on ViT Notebook

The file `HP_ViT.ipynb` **cannot be previewed directly on GitHub** due to a rendering issue.  
However, it can be downloaded and executed locally without any problems.

All `.py` files replicate the logic of their corresponding notebooks and serve as a backup if `.ipynb` preview is unavailable.
